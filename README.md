# Climate Change Economics

## Question
The questions I want to answer with this project are the following:

•	How does climate change affect the natural world?

•	How does climate change affect a country's agricultural production?

•	How does a country's readiness mitigate vulnerability to the effects of climate change?

## Summary
•	The rapid rise of carbon dioxide in the last  two centuries has cause major changes in the Earth’s surface temperature, ice sheet mass, and  the global sea level.

•	The social cost of carbon (SCC) is a measure, in dollars, of the long-term damage done by a ton of carbon dioxide in a given year. The social cost of carbon is projected to rise over the next 100 years.

•	The projection of cereal yields under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) show overall a decrease in due to climate change.

•	Developed countries have integrated adaption policies into there overall development, while developing countries have lagged behind. This mean that developed countries have the highest readiness for climate change, while developing countries have the highest vulnerability to climate change.

This project focuses on the effects that climate change has on economies using R Shiny application. The application showcases the following:

•	Trends for the global carbon dioxide concentration

•	Trends for the global surface temperature

•	Trends for the mass change in Antarctica

•	Trends for the sea level rise

•	Projection for the social cost of carbon 

•	Projection for grain production under different scenarios

•	Trends for country's readiness/vulnerability to climate change

## Motivation
The motivation behind choosing this topic is the prevalence of warnings that researcher are giving the public, and the sizable opposition to the acceptance of the danger from the public. Along with dangers such as rising sea temperatures and more intense extreme weather events, major impact on the economy has been touted. Emphasizing the economic impact of climate change gives more clout to the public than ecological ones like disappearing coral reef, even though they may not be mutually exclusive.
